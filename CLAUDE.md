## Recent Updates

### Navigation Design Enhancement (2025-09-04)
**Issue**: Navigation bar alignment was cramped to the left, creating visual disconnect with centered content below

**Solution Applied**:
- **World-class Proportional Design**: Replaced cramped flex layout with CSS Grid (`grid-cols-3`)
- **Progressive Responsive Padding**: Added elegant scaling padding (`px-8` to `2xl:px-24`)
- **Removed Container Constraints**: Eliminated `max-w-screen-xl` limitation for full-width balance
- **True Visual Balance**: Each section (logo, navigation, CTA) gets equal visual weight
- **Perfect Centering**: Navigation items now truly centered in their dedicated column
- **Mobile Integration**: Proper mobile menu placement within grid structure

**Files Modified**: `components/navigation.tsx`
**Commits**: `2119dd8`, `30789ff`

### Form Submission System Overhaul (2025-09-04)
**Issue**: Both Pilot Program and Contact forms experiencing critical submission failures
- Initial error: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"
- reCAPTCHA errors: "reCAPTCHA has already been rendered in this element"  
- Form timeouts: "CAPTCHA verification timed out. Please try again"
- Email delivery failure: Domain verification errors with Resend

**Root Cause Analysis & Solutions**:

**Phase 1: reCAPTCHA Infrastructure Rebuild**
- **Problem**: Infinite initialization loops caused by React dependency chains
- **Solution**: Created centralized `RecaptchaManager` singleton with proper lifecycle management
- **Implementation**: 
  - Converted to `forwardRef` pattern with `useImperativeHandle`
  - Used `useId()` for unique container identification
  - Implemented proper cleanup on component unmount
  - Added widget existence checks to prevent duplicates

**Phase 2: Promise-Based Execution Pattern**
- **Problem**: Race conditions between token receipt and polling timeout
- **Solution**: Replaced polling mechanism with Promise-based reCAPTCHA execution
- **Implementation**:
  - `executeRecaptcha()` returns Promise resolved by verification callback
  - Used `Promise.race()` with cancellable timeout
  - Direct Promise resolution eliminates polling delays
  - Proper error propagation through Promise rejection

**Phase 3: Email Service Configuration**
- **Problem**: Resend domain verification failure (`axiomlegaldata.com` not verified)
- **Solution**: Switched to Resend's pre-verified domain
- **Fix**: Changed from `no-reply@axiomlegaldata.com` to `onboarding@resend.dev`
- **Result**: Immediate email delivery without domain verification requirements

**Phase 4: Implementation Synchronization**
- **Problem**: Contact form still using legacy polling approach after pilot program fix
- **Solution**: Synchronized both forms to identical Promise-based implementation
- **Details**: Added matching console logging, error handling, and execution flow

### Final Form System Status: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

**Both Forms Now Feature**:
- ✅ **Invisible reCAPTCHA**: Background verification without user interaction
- ✅ **Promise-Based Execution**: No race conditions or timeout errors
- ✅ **Reliable Email Delivery**: Using verified Resend domain
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Clear user feedback for all failure scenarios
- ✅ **Production-Ready**: Clean console output, no infinite loops
- ✅ **Identical Implementation**: Consistent behavior across all forms

**Key Files Modified**:
- `lib/recaptcha-manager.ts` - Centralized widget management
- `components/recaptcha-wrapper.tsx` - Promise-based component architecture
- `components/pilot-program-form.tsx` - Production-ready form implementation  
- `components/contact-form.tsx` - Synchronized with pilot program form
- `app/api/pilot-program/route.ts` - Email domain configuration
- `app/api/contact/route.ts` - Email domain configuration

**Solution Applied**: Complete local Sanity Studio setup

**Implementation Steps**:
