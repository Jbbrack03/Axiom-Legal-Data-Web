# Claude Code Session Summary

## Project Status: ✅ Successfully Deployed

### Issue Resolution Timeline

**Problem**: Vercel deployment failing with "A commit author is required" error
- Initial repository had Git commits with inconsistent/missing author information
- Vercel couldn't process the commit history properly

**Solution Steps**:
1. **Git Author Configuration**: Set up proper Git identity with consistent email
2. **Repository Migration**: Created fresh repository at `https://github.com/Jbbrack03/Axiom-Legal-Data-Web`
3. **Dependency Synchronization**: Fixed `pnpm-lock.yaml` out-of-sync issue with `package.json`

### Final Working Configuration

**Repository**: `https://github.com/Jbbrack03/Axiom-Legal-Data-Web`  
**Git Config**: 
- Name: `Jbbrack03`
- Email: `Jbbrack03@users.noreply.github.com`

## Recent Updates

### Navigation Design Enhancement (2025-09-04)
**Issue**: Navigation bar alignment was cramped to the left, creating visual disconnect with centered content below

**Solution Applied**:
- **World-class Proportional Design**: Replaced cramped flex layout with CSS Grid (`grid-cols-3`)
- **Progressive Responsive Padding**: Added elegant scaling padding (`px-8` to `2xl:px-24`)
- **Removed Container Constraints**: Eliminated `max-w-screen-xl` limitation for full-width balance
- **True Visual Balance**: Each section (logo, navigation, CTA) gets equal visual weight
- **Perfect Centering**: Navigation items now truly centered in their dedicated column
- **Mobile Integration**: Proper mobile menu placement within grid structure

**Files Modified**: `components/navigation.tsx`
**Commits**: `2119dd8`, `30789ff`

### Notes for Future Development
- All Git commits now have proper author information
- Lockfile is synchronized with package.json
- Ready for continuous deployment through Vercel
- Environment variables configured and documented
- Navigation now uses modern CSS Grid layout for optimal visual balance
