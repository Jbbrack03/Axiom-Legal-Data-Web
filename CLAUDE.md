## Recent Updates

### Navigation Design Enhancement (2025-09-04)
**Issue**: Navigation bar alignment was cramped to the left, creating visual disconnect with centered content below

**Solution Applied**:
- **World-class Proportional Design**: Replaced cramped flex layout with CSS Grid (`grid-cols-3`)
- **Progressive Responsive Padding**: Added elegant scaling padding (`px-8` to `2xl:px-24`)
- **Removed Container Constraints**: Eliminated `max-w-screen-xl` limitation for full-width balance
- **True Visual Balance**: Each section (logo, navigation, CTA) gets equal visual weight
- **Perfect Centering**: Navigation items now truly centered in their dedicated column
- **Mobile Integration**: Proper mobile menu placement within grid structure

**Files Modified**: `components/navigation.tsx`
**Commits**: `2119dd8`, `30789ff`

### Form Submission System Overhaul (2025-09-04)
**Issue**: Both Pilot Program and Contact forms experiencing critical submission failures
- Initial error: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"
- reCAPTCHA errors: "reCAPTCHA has already been rendered in this element"  
- Form timeouts: "CAPTCHA verification timed out. Please try again"
- Email delivery failure: Domain verification errors with Resend

**Root Cause Analysis & Solutions**:

**Phase 1: reCAPTCHA Infrastructure Rebuild**
- **Problem**: Infinite initialization loops caused by React dependency chains
- **Solution**: Created centralized `RecaptchaManager` singleton with proper lifecycle management
- **Implementation**: 
  - Converted to `forwardRef` pattern with `useImperativeHandle`
  - Used `useId()` for unique container identification
  - Implemented proper cleanup on component unmount
  - Added widget existence checks to prevent duplicates

**Phase 2: Promise-Based Execution Pattern**
- **Problem**: Race conditions between token receipt and polling timeout
- **Solution**: Replaced polling mechanism with Promise-based reCAPTCHA execution
- **Implementation**:
  - `executeRecaptcha()` returns Promise resolved by verification callback
  - Used `Promise.race()` with cancellable timeout
  - Direct Promise resolution eliminates polling delays
  - Proper error propagation through Promise rejection

**Phase 3: Email Service Configuration**
- **Problem**: Resend domain verification failure (`axiomlegaldata.com` not verified)
- **Solution**: Switched to Resend's pre-verified domain
- **Fix**: Changed from `no-reply@axiomlegaldata.com` to `onboarding@resend.dev`
- **Result**: Immediate email delivery without domain verification requirements

**Phase 4: Implementation Synchronization**
- **Problem**: Contact form still using legacy polling approach after pilot program fix
- **Solution**: Synchronized both forms to identical Promise-based implementation
- **Details**: Added matching console logging, error handling, and execution flow

### Final Form System Status: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

**Both Forms Now Feature**:
- ✅ **Invisible reCAPTCHA**: Background verification without user interaction
- ✅ **Promise-Based Execution**: No race conditions or timeout errors
- ✅ **Reliable Email Delivery**: Using verified Resend domain
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Clear user feedback for all failure scenarios
- ✅ **Production-Ready**: Clean console output, no infinite loops
- ✅ **Identical Implementation**: Consistent behavior across all forms

**Key Files Modified**:
- `lib/recaptcha-manager.ts` - Centralized widget management
- `components/recaptcha-wrapper.tsx` - Promise-based component architecture
- `components/pilot-program-form.tsx` - Production-ready form implementation  
- `components/contact-form.tsx` - Synchronized with pilot program form
- `app/api/pilot-program/route.ts` - Email domain configuration
- `app/api/contact/route.ts` - Email domain configuration

**Critical Commits**: `1b0c927`, `4dc7bb1`, `2e173cf`, `4459936`, `8f5695d`, `e67b264`

## Sanity CMS Studio Setup (2025-09-05)
**Issue**: User needed access to Sanity CMS for blog content creation but had no studio interface
- Project had Sanity client configured (`@sanity/client`, schemas defined) but no local studio
- Sanity dashboard showed "connect a studio" prompt with no web-based option available

**Solution Applied**: Complete local Sanity Studio setup

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Global CLI Installation**: Installed `@sanity/cli@4.6.1` globally
2. **Studio Directory Creation**: Created `/studio` folder in project root
3. **Manual Configuration**: Bypassed CLI authentication issues by creating config files manually
4. **Schema Integration**: Copied existing schemas from `/sanity/schemas/` to studio
5. **Dependency Resolution**: Installed required packages (`sanity@^3.0.0`, `@sanity/vision`, `styled-components`)

**Final Configuration**:
- **Studio URL**: `http://localhost:3333/`
- **Project ID**: `5oqt7nq0`
- **Dataset**: `production`
- **Schemas**: Blog Post, Author, Block Content (with full SEO fields)

**Key Files Created**:
- `studio/package.json` - Studio-specific dependencies and scripts
- `studio/sanity.config.ts` - Studio configuration with project settings
- `studio/schemas/` - Complete schema definitions copied from main project

**Studio Features Available**:
- ✅ **Author Management**: Create author profiles with bio, image, role, social links
- ✅ **Blog Post Creation**: Full-featured editor with rich text, images, tags, SEO
- ✅ **Content Preview**: Live preview of content structure
- ✅ **Image Upload**: Hotspot-enabled image handling

**Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** - Studio running at `http://localhost:3334/`

## Blog System Optimization & Functionality Fixes (2025-09-05)
**Issue**: Multiple blog functionality issues identified and resolved
- Duplicate navigation items causing user confusion (Methodology vs Blog)
- Homepage blog section showing static placeholder content instead of Sanity data
- Blog page showing "Coming Soon" despite having content in Sanity
- Missing RSS feed functionality for blog sharing
- Server-side rendering errors when accessing individual blog posts

**Solution Applied**: Complete blog system overhaul and optimization

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Navigation Cleanup**: Removed redundant "Methodology" navigation item, streamlined to Blog | Pilot Program | Contact
2. **Homepage Integration**: Updated `FeaturedContent` component to pull latest 3 posts from Sanity with fallback content
3. **RSS Feed Creation**: Built custom RSS endpoint at `/api/rss` with proper XML generation and caching headers  
4. **RSS Discovery**: Added RSS feed metadata to site head for automatic discovery by RSS readers
5. **Hydration Fix**: Resolved server-side rendering errors by extracting client-side Share button functionality

**Technical Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Navigation Streamlining**: Removed `/app/methodology/` and updated navigation component
- ✅ **Dynamic Homepage Content**: `components/featured-content.tsx` now async component fetching from Sanity
- ✅ **RSS Feed Generation**: `/app/api/rss/route.ts` generates proper RSS XML from Sanity blog posts
- ✅ **SEO Optimization**: RSS feed discoverable via `<link rel="alternate">` in site metadata
- ✅ **Hydration Error Resolution**: Extracted Share button to `components/share-button.tsx` client component

**Key Files Modified**:
